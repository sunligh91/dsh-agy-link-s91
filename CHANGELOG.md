# Changelog

## 0.4.32 (2026-09-24)

- **Fixed: every tool-continuation span failed with `request carries no user text
  or images to forward to agy`, and the digest could absorb command output.**
  - **Symptom**: after agy emitted a mirrored tool card, the next span died with
    that error even though the tool result had come back.
  - **Root cause**: DSH **session format v4** (dsh >= 0.1.7) promotes tool results
    to their own first-class `tool` role — `ToolResultMessage.role = 'tool'`,
    `MessageRoleMap.tool`, `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION = 4`. v3 modelled them as
    `user` messages carrying a `tool-result` block. `detectContinuation` still
    required `role === 'user'`, so it never matched: the adapter fell through to
    prompt assembly, the tool result was filtered out of the trailing-user run,
    and the prompt came out empty → the error above.
  - **Second, quieter defect**: v4 tool results carry plain `text` blocks, so v3's
    incidental protection (a `tool-result` block is not `text`, hence `textOf`
    returned `''`) disappeared. Command output would have been digested as
    `Assistant: <stdout>` and handed to agy as if the model had said it.
  - **Fix**: target v4 only.
    - `detectContinuation` now accepts `role === 'tool'` (v3 `user` tool results are
      deliberately rejected).
    - `buildDigest` skips `tool` and `developer` messages, so tool output and
      session metadata never enter the digest.
    - Both checks read the message structurally, keeping the adapter correct
      regardless of which `dsh-llm` the type-checker resolves (the host supplies
      the real module through `peerDependencies`).
- **Tests**: the shared continuation fixture and the `detectContinuation` unit test
  were still building v3-shaped messages (`role: 'user'` + `tool-result`), which is
  why they only failed once the adapter became v4-only; both now build the v4
  shape, with an explicit assertion that a v3-shaped tool result is rejected. Added
  a digest regression test covering `tool` and `developer` exclusion.
- Suite: **184 tests, 177 passing**. The 7 failures are pre-existing and unrelated
  (follow-up digest, compaction prompt/ADR-013, adapter cwd ×2, multimodal staging);
  identical to the baseline recorded for 0.4.31 — no new failures.

## 0.4.31 (2026-09-21)

- **Fixed: the quota panel showed a permanent 100% for every model family.**
  - **Symptom**: the Antigravity card reported Gemini, Claude and GPT-OSS at 100%
    with an unchanging reset date, while `agy --print "/quota"` reported Gemini's
    weekly limit at 90% and its 5-hour limit at 55%. Pressing **刷新额度** never
    changed anything.
  - **Root cause**: a field-casing mismatch. `v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary`
    returns **snake_case** — buckets carry `remaining_fraction` / `reset_time` and
    groups carry `name` — but the parser read camelCase `remainingFraction` /
    `resetTime` and `group.displayName`. Every bucket therefore resolved to
    `undefined`, the group never matched a family, and the client's `?? 1`
    fallback rendered the missing values as a confident 100%.
  - **Fix**: both spellings are now accepted and normalized at read time —
    `b.remainingFraction ?? b.remaining_fraction`, `b.resetTime ?? b.reset_time`,
    `group.displayName || group.name` (and `entry.quotaInfo.*` for the per-model
    list). The bucket-window test also accepts `id` alongside `bucketId`, and the
    response types document both shapes.
  - A casing change on Google's side can no longer silently blank the panel: an
    unparsed bucket stays `undefined` rather than masquerading as a full tank.
    (Making the UI distinguish "unknown" from 100% is left as a follow-up.)
- **Tests**: the old mocks returned camelCase — i.e. they encoded the same wrong
  assumption as the code, which is why the suite stayed green through this bug.
  Both mocks now use the **real wire shape** captured live from agy 1.2.4, and a new
  regression test (`refreshAccountQuota normalizes snake_case AND camelCase quota
  buckets`) asserts 6 values against each shape. Verified to fail on the unfixed
  parser (`expected: 0.55`) and pass after the fix.
- Suite: 176/183 passing. The 7 remaining failures are **pre-existing and unrelated**
  (follow-up digest, compaction prompt/ADR-013, adapter cwd ×2, multimodal staging);
  verified identical on the unmodified tree via `git stash`. Net effect of this
  release: one added test, zero new failures.

## 0.4.30 (2026-09-13)

- **Added: a full settings panel — every option is now editable in the GUI.**
  - All settable options (the watchdog, answer salvage, model/effort, concurrency,
    rate limiting, media, and the advanced fallbacks) render as controls in the
    Antigravity settings card, each with its own explanation. Previously only
    permission mode, effort and pool scheduling were exposed; the rest required
    hand-editing `runtime-overrides.json`.
  - **One source of truth**: the new `src/common/settings-schema.ts` declares each
    option (key, kind, bounds, group, label, description, env var) once. The host
    validates `/plugins/agy-link/config` writes against it and reports effective
    values from it; the browser generates the controls from the same list. A new
    option therefore needs no UI code, and the panel cannot offer a key the server
    would reject or drift out of sync with it.
  - Numbers commit on blur/Enter, not per keystroke, so a half-typed value never
    reaches the server. Out-of-range or non-numeric input is rejected by the
    endpoint with an actionable message instead of being stored.
  - Millisecond options show a live human-readable hint (`600000` → `= 10 分钟`).
  - Options already pinned in `runtime-overrides.json` are badged **已自定义**;
    the `DSH_AGY_*` env var that overrides a setting is shown on its row. When an
    env var outranks a save, the panel says so instead of pretending the write won.
  - The card stays scannable by keeping the everyday controls visible
    (`timeoutMs` and the `salvageAnswers` switch) while the fine-tuning numbers
    (`salvagePollMs`, `salvageIdleMs`, `salvageMinChars`) and the rest of the
    less common options sit behind a collapsible 「高级选项」 fold, which reports
    how many options are inside it.
- **Fixed: a completed answer was thrown away when agy stalled without writing
  it to stdout.**
  - **Symptom**: long turns died with `agy run was idle for 600000ms without output`
    (code `TIMEOUT`, after `已重试模型请求 (1/1)`), yet re-prompting showed the model
    had actually finished — its full answer was already on disk.
  - **Root cause**: the activity watchdog only watches the child's stdout/stderr.
    agy persists every completed turn to its own conversation transcript, so when
    the response SSE stalls (observed at a quota boundary: the last log line is
    `streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` and nothing follows) agy has the answer in
    hand while stdout stays silent. After `timeoutMs` of silence the watchdog
    killed the process and the finished work was discarded.
    Measured on the affected run: the answer landed at `06:40:10`, the kill came
    at `06:47:51` — **7m41s of usable answer sat on disk before it was lost**.
  - **Fix**: a **salvage watcher** polls the conversation transcript while a run is
    alive. When it finds a finished answer that (a) post-dates the spawn-time
    baseline, (b) is a terminal `PLANNER_RESPONSE`/`DONE` record and (c) carries no
    `tool_calls` (in 844 real records, 822 carry `tool_calls` and 22 carry content —
    never both, so the presence of `tool_calls` reliably identifies a mid-turn
    dispatch), the bridge adopts it as the run's result envelope and ends the turn
    **as a success**. A last-chance check runs on the timeout path too, in case
    the watchdog fires in the same tick as the answer landing.
  - The recovered answer streams as ordinary assistant text, followed by an
    explicit note (`[agy 已完成但未回传输出 · 答案从本地 transcript 恢复（step N）]`),
    so a salvaged turn is never mistaken for one that streamed normally. The
    event is also logged.
  - New config: `salvageAnswers` (default `true`, env `DSH_AGY_SALVAGE`),
    `salvagePollMs` (default `10000`, env `DSH_AGY_SALVAGE_POLL_MS`),
    `salvageIdleMs` (default `45000`, env `DSH_AGY_SALVAGE_IDLE_MS`),
    `salvageMinChars` (default `40`). A required silence window means a run still
    streaming on stdout is never pre-empted. New env `DSH_AGY_CLI_HOME` locates the
    agy data directory when it is not under the account home.
  - Pool accounts are read from their own isolated home, so multi-account setups
    salvage from the right transcript.
- **Fixed: 15 adapter tests could not run on Windows.**
  - `spawn` of the `.mjs` fixture failed with `EFTYPE`: Windows has no file
    association for the extension and does not honour the shebang. Tests now use
    a `fake-agy.cmd` shim on Windows (the same path a real `agy.cmd` install takes,
    which `runner.ts` already detects via `isCmdShim`), while POSIX keeps executing
    the script directly. Added a `stall` fake-agy mode to cover the salvage path.
- **Tests**: added `test/salvage.test.ts` (11 cases: extraction rules, baseline
  rejection, torn-line tolerance, home resolution) and `test/salvage-e2e.test.ts`
  (2 cases: end-to-end recovery from a real stall, and an ordinary run staying
  untouched). Suite goes from 130/152 to 160/167 passing; the 7 remaining failures
  are pre-existing and unrelated (verified identical on the unmodified tree).

## 0.4.29 (2026-09-11)

- **Fixed: plugin tree failed to load after the 0.4.28 rename (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).**
  - **Root cause**: the fork renamed the package to `dsh-agy-link-s91` in `package.json` only, leaving two hardcoded copies of the old name behind. DSH keys both host plugins and client modules **by package name**, so the composition tried to import `dsh-agy-link` — a package that no longer existed — and the whole plugin tree failed to load.
  - `cordis.patch.yml`: `insert[].name` was still `dsh-agy-link` (the server-side entry point).
  - `tsdown.config.ts`: the client bundle's `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id })` banner was still `dsh-agy-link`, so the host's `require("dsh-agy-link-s91")` missed (client-side module key).
  - **Fix**: `PKG_NAME` in `src/common/types.ts` is now the single source of truth for the plugin's identity; `src/index.ts` derives its exported module id from it, and the two remaining literal sites were updated to match. A comment block on `PKG_NAME` lists every place that must stay in lockstep, so a future rename cannot miss one again.
- **Docs: corrected the install command in `cordis.patch.yml`** to the fork's git source.

## 0.4.28 (2026-09-11) — Fork: dsh-agy-link-s91
> Forked from [amlyczz/dsh-agy-link](https://github.com/amlyczz/dsh-agy-link) @ v0.4.27.
> Carries local optimizations for Windows long-context workloads.

- **Fixed: `spawn ENAMETOOLONG` on Windows with large context injection.**
  - **Root cause**: the full prompt was passed as a command-line argument (`-p "<prompt>"`). Windows `CreateProcessW` caps the whole command line at **32,767 UTF-16 characters** (a hard NT kernel `UNICODE_STRING` limit that cannot be raised by registry or policy). Memory-injection plugins (e.g. `dsh-memory-palace` with a large `workspaceBudgetChars`) could easily push the assembled prompt past that ceiling, so `agy.exe` could never be spawned.
  - **Fix**: the prompt is now written to **stdin** as an NDJSON stream message (`{"event":"user","message":{"content":...}}`) with `--input-format stream-json`. The command line shrinks to a few hundred characters regardless of prompt size, and prompt length is bounded only by memory. Verified end-to-end with a 100,000-character prompt.
  - `RunOptions.stdinPayload` added in `src/host/runner.ts`; `buildArgs` learns `useStdinPrompt` in `src/host/adapter.ts`; `src/host/oneshot.ts` (the `agy_ask` one-shot path, which also carries large file context) converted to the same transport.
  - Output protocol is unchanged — the stream is still `--output-format stream-json`, so the downstream parser and all tool mirroring keep working untouched.
- **Fixed: retry after a failed spawn was swallowed as `Duplicate request ignored`.**
  - When `startAgyProcess` threw (e.g. `ENAMETOOLONG`), the per-session entry in `activeSessionPrompts` was never released. The host's automatic retry ~2s later landed inside the 10s debounce window and was rejected with `Duplicate request ignored: an identical request is already running for this session`, masking the real error.
  - The `catch` path now clears `activeSessionPrompts` for non-auxiliary calls before rethrowing.
- **Changed: `MAX_RETAINED_RUNS` default raised from `8` to `640`.**
  - The bounded `RunRegistry` kept only the most recent 8 runs, so in long agentic sessions (hundreds of `agy_tool` mirrored calls) earlier runs were evicted and a continuation span could fail with `no longer available`. The registry now retains 640 runs by default.
  - New **`DSH_AGY_MAX_RUNS` environment variable** overrides the default (positive safe integers only) for users who need a different ceiling: `export DSH_AGY_MAX_RUNS=2000`.
- **Inherited from upstream 0.4.27**: official Google installer path probing (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin\agy.exe`) and Linux Secret Service quota support.


## 0.4.27 (2026-09-11)

- **Fixed: Windows binary discovery misses the official Google installer path (Issue #7).**
  - `resolveAgyBin()` now probes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin\agy.exe` (plus `.cmd`/`.bat` siblings and the WinGet Links shim), so installs via `irm https://antigravity.google/cli/install.ps1 | iex` no longer raise `AGY_NOT_INSTALLED` when PATH has not propagated to the GUI process.
- **Fixed: Quota unavailable on Linux (Issue #8).**
  - Added `readLinuxSecretToken()`: the primary account's OAuth credential is now read from the FreeDesktop Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet) via `secret-tool`, with a python3-dbus fallback — the same `service="gemini" / username="antigravity"` go-keyring slot agy writes on Linux.
  - `QuotaService.readSystemKeychainToken()` now dispatches per platform (darwin → Keychain, linux → Secret Service), restoring quota refresh on Linux where no on-disk token file exists.
  - Shared go-keyring payload parsing (raw or `go-keyring-base64:` prefixed JSON) extracted into `parseGoKeyringPayload`.

## 0.4.26 (2026-09-07)

- **Added: Support for `gemini-3.8-flash` in Fallback Models Catalog (Issue #6).**
  - **Root cause**: `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_MODELS` defined in `src/common/types.ts` had not been synced with Google's latest model line-up, stopping at `gemini-3.7-flash`. When DSH booted or ran offline prior to dynamic `agy models` discovery, `gemini-3.8-flash` was missing from the model picker.
  - **Fix**: Added `{ id: 'gemini-3.8-flash', name: 'Gemini 3.8 Flash', efforts: ['low', 'medium', 'high'] }` to `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_MODELS`.
- **Fixed: Client Bundle `process is not defined` (PR #5 / realguan).**
  - In `tsdown.config.ts`, marked `react-dom` and `react/jsx-runtime` as external dependencies for client bundling (`platform: "browser"`), preventing development React runtime from being inlined into `dist/client.js` and eliminating browser `ReferenceError: process is not defined`.
- **Hardened: Test Suite Stability & Debounce Timing on macOS.**
  - Relaxed duplicate submission debounce window in `AgyAdapter` to 10,000ms with automatic size-capped map pruning, and adjusted test thresholds to account for cold Node subprocess spawning latency on macOS. All 151 unit tests passing.

## 0.4.25 (2026-09-04)

- **Fixed: Plugin Startup Blocker on DSH >= 0.1.1-rc.x / 0.1.2-rc.1 (`missing export 'CallId'`, issue #4).**
  - **Root cause**: Newer `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` versions (e.g. `0.1.2-alpha.1` ~ `0.1.2-rc.1`) renamed `CallId` to `ToolCallId`. A named import `import { CallId } from '@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm'` caused Node ESM static resolution to fail at startup with `The requested module '@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm' does not provide an export named 'CallId'`, surfacing as a plugin load failure on DSH Desktop 2.0.5 and CLI.
  - **Fix**: Replaced named import with a namespace fallback resolution `toToolCallId = dshLlm.ToolCallId ?? dshLlm.CallId ?? identity`. This avoids missing named export evaluation errors and ensures seamless backwards and forwards compatibility across all DSH host versions.
  - **Ecosystem & Test Hardening**: Upgraded development dependencies to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*@0.1.2-rc.1`. Configured `--test-concurrency=1` in test runner to prevent mock environment variable collisions across concurrent subprocess tests, achieving 100% pass rate across all 151 unit tests. Verified live startup with DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 and `dsh-lark-link`.

## 0.4.24 (2026-08-28)

- **Fixed: Antigravity Models Missing From Picker When Logged In (已登录/显示余量但模型列表不显示 — issue #1).**
  - **Decoupled Adapter Registration from Synchronous Binary Discovery**: `registerAdapter` now executes regardless of initial `bin()` probe results (using resilient fallback model catalog), ensuring the Antigravity provider is never dropped during startup even if CLI path resolution is deferred.
  - **Expanded macOS / Linux GUI App Path Discovery**: extended `resolveAgyBin` search candidates to include `~/.bun/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/share/pnpm`, `~/Library/pnpm`, `~/.yarn/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, NVM (`~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`), FNM, Volta, ASDF shims, Linuxbrew, etc., fixing GUI desktop apps starting with minimal default system PATH.
  - **Account-Aware Model Discovery & Environment Isolation**: model discovery now inherits current active/primary account isolated environment and proxy settings, falling back across ready pool accounts if default system HOME is unauthenticated.
  - **Defensive Model & Effort Sanitization**: defensive catalog cleaning against empty IDs, blank names, empty reasoning effort arrays, and out-of-bounds `defaultEffort` to strictly satisfy DSH host validation and prevent fail-all provider group drops (`INVALID_CATALOG` / `INVALID_MODEL_*`).
  - **Cross-Platform & Unit Tests**: added defensive catalog normalization and explicit binary path resolution tests across test suites.

## 0.4.23 (2026-08-27)

- **Enhanced: Antigravity Tool Mirroring with Native Git +/- Diff Cards & Full Tool Vocabulary.**
  - **Tool Vocabulary & Parameter Mapping**: mapped agy's official editing tool `replace_file_content` (`TargetFile`, `TargetContent`, `ReplacementContent`, `Description`, `Instruction`) and write tool `write_to_file` (`TargetFile`, `CodeContent`, `Overwrite`, `Description`) to DSH native `DiffCallView` / `DiffResultView` cards.
  - **Git Head Base Line Diffing**: added cross-platform `getGitHeadContent` to retrieve committed file content for full-file writes (`write_to_file`), allowing DSH to render line-by-line git `+`/`-` additions and deletions rather than treating existing modified files as blank new files.
  - **Expanded Tool Support**: mapped `view_file` (with `AbsolutePath`/`StartLine` line location navigation), `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `ask_question`, `read_url_content`, and `generate_image` onto their respective native/generic tool cards with descriptive titles.
  - **Cross-Platform Hardened**: path normalization with forward-slash compatibility across Windows/macOS/Linux, `windowsHide: true`, strict subprocess timeout, and safe error fallback.

## 0.4.22 (2026-08-27)

- **Fixed: `registration.adapter.prepareCall is not a function` on new DSH hosts (本轮运行失败 UNKNOWN).**
  - **Field report**: after upgrading the DSH host (manjh's source checkout), every turn failed immediately with `registration.adapter.prepareCall is not a function` — category UNKNOWN in the GUI, no reply at all.
  - **Root cause (interface drift)**: dsh-llm >= 0.1.1-rc.2 added `LlmAdapter.prepareCall(provider, model, signal)` and `LlmRuntime.prepareCall()` now calls `registration.adapter.prepareCall(...)` **unconditionally** (both the prepared-call path and the direct `adapterStream` path). The plugin's devDependency pinned `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm ^0.1.0-rc.6` (base class without `prepareCall`); when the plugin's adapter class resolved an older dsh-llm copy than the host runtime, `registration.adapter.prepareCall` was `undefined` and every turn threw a bare TypeError.
  - **Fix**: `AgyAdapter` now implements `prepareCall` explicitly, returning `{ model: await this.resolveModel(...), stream: options => this.stream(options) }` — the exact one-generation capability-bound handle the new runtime expects (same shape as the base default, but present regardless of which dsh-llm copy the plugin resolves). Backward compatible: runtimes < 0.1.1-rc.2 never call it. The method is declared structurally (no `override` / new-type import) so the plugin keeps typechecking against dsh-llm `^0.1.0-rc.6` and the repo's `npm ci` peer resolution stays intact; the runtime contract matches the 0.1.1-rc.2 `PreparedAdapterCall` shape.
  - Regression test pins the contract end-to-end: `prepareCall` returns resolved model metadata (id/provider/defaultMaxTokens) plus a stream that runs a full fake turn.

## 0.4.21 (2026-08-27)

- **Fixed: Silent `agy exited with code 1` Hid the Real Cause (发送消息无回复、只见 exit 1).**
  - **Field report**: a user session log showed every turn failing with the bare message `agy exited with code 1` (code PROCESS_EXIT, empty stderr, zero tokens) — each attempt ran ~7–10s, failed once, retried once, failed again, and the UI never surfaced WHY (no reply text at all).
  - **Root cause of the blindness (verified live against agy 1.1.22)**: agy reports its failure as a `result` envelope on **stdout** (`{"event":"result",...,"status":"ERROR","error":"<human-readable reason>"}`) and exits 1 with EMPTY stderr — e.g. an invalid model/effort pairing fails instantly with `--model gemini-3.7-flash requires --effort (available: low, medium, high)`. The adapter's non-zero-exit branch dropped that envelope entirely: rate-limit-shaped errors were still classified (the classifier already read `lastResultError`), but any OTHER failure degraded to the bare exit-code line with no cause.
  - **Fix**: the PROCESS_EXIT failure message now prefers the stdout envelope's error text (falling back to the stderr tail). Same error code and retry policy; users finally see agy's own reason, e.g. `agy exited with code 1: upstream request failed while generating` or `…: --model gemini-3.7-flash requires --effort (available: low, medium, high)`.
  - **Diagnostics unaffected**: `/agy doctor` (`~/.dsh/agy-link/diagnostics/doctor-*.md`) still carries the full redacted raw stdout tail for deeper incidents.
  - Regression test pins the exact silent-failure shape (stdout envelope + exit 1 + empty stderr) via a new `exit-error` fake-agy mode.

## 0.4.20 (2026-08-27)

- **Fixed: Primary Account Quota Fetched With a STALE Token (主账号刷新/同步拿的值不对).**
  - **Root cause (verified live)**: on macOS, agy >= 1.1.15 keeps its CURRENT credential in the Keychain; the on-disk `antigravity-oauth-token` was a stale leftover from a PREVIOUS account's login. `getStoredToken` read the disk file FIRST and only fell back to the Keychain — so every 刷新/同步 used the old account's (still-valid) token and displayed ITS quota under the current login's name (observed: agy authenticated as q98… while the disk file still held elegantmanco's token; UI showed the wrong account's 5h/weekly numbers).
  - **Keychain-first token resolution**: for the primary / system-HOME account the Keychain credential now WINS over the on-disk file (disk remains the fallback for older agy builds and non-mac systems). Isolated pool accounts are pinned by test to never touch the shared Keychain. Verified end-to-end against live Google endpoints: the primary's token identity and quota now match the actual agy login (5h 91% / weekly 31% instead of the stale account's numbers).
  - **Token-anchored identity on manual refresh**: `refreshAccountQuota(force=true)` additionally calls the OAuth userinfo endpoint once per explicit user click and re-labels the slot to the token's TRUE owner (`resetAccountIdentity`), so an external `agy logout` + re-login self-heals in one click even when logs disagree.
  - **Log detection hardened**: `detectEmailFromAgyLogs` returns the LAST match per file (append-ordered logs → newest login wins), fixing first-match returning a superseded account.
  - **Risk posture preserved**: background polls (force=false) still NEVER call userinfo — zero extra network on the automatic path (pinned by a regression test).

## 0.4.19 (2026-08-26)

- **Fixed: Antigravity Models Missing From the Model Picker (登录成功、额度正常但模型列表为空 — issue #1).**
  - **Root cause**: when `agy models` lists a bare Gemini base alongside its effort variants (the agy 1.1.13 output shape, e.g. `gemini-3.7-flash` + `gemini-3.7-flash-medium`), `foldEfforts` emitted the base id TWICE — once as the folded base entry and once as a verbatim row. DSH's `llm.listModels` contract throws `INVALID_CATALOG` on any duplicate model id, and the host's model-catalog builder then drops the ENTIRE Antigravity provider group from the picker — so login and quota panels looked perfectly healthy while no Antigravity model could be selected.
  - **Fix (three layers)**: (1) `foldEfforts` now absorbs the bare base into its folded entry instead of duplicating it; (2) `parseModelsOutput` dedupes repeated raw slugs (first occurrence wins); (3) `AgyAdapter.listModels` dedupes ids as a final guard, so even a user-configured `fallbackModels` list containing repeats can never nuke the whole group.
  - Regression tests pin both bare-base-plus-variants shapes and the duplicate-slug parse, plus an adapter-level uniqueness guard test.
  - **Observability**: when the adapter-level guard drops duplicate ids it now logs which ids were removed (`model catalog contained duplicate ids [...]`) so field instances surface in DSH server logs instead of being silently masked. When reporting picker issues, attach the `/agy doctor` report (`~/.dsh/agy-link/diagnostics/doctor-*.md`) and the raw `agy models` output.

## 0.4.18 (2026-08-25)

- **Quota Fallback Never Clobbers Good Data (5h=100%/weekly-missing 根因).**
  - **What happened**: `retrieveUserQuotaSummary` transiently failed (proxy blip) while `fetchAvailableModels` still answered; the per-model fallback then OVERWROTE the stored family entry with a single-window partial shape — weeklyFraction vanished and the 5h row received wrong-window numbers (observed 5h=100%, reset a week out, weekly `—`, while the live API actually reported 5h 84% / weekly 47%).
  - **`mergeFallbackFamilyQuota`**: last-known-good complete family data now always wins over partial fallback; the fallback only fills families with no usable previous entry (first-ever refresh). Verified live: both endpoints answer correctly and a successful summary refresh fully restores the display.
  - Added `scripts/diag-quota.mts` one-shot endpoint probe for future incidents.

## 0.4.17 (2026-08-25)

- **Ghost-Cooldown & Quota-Display Fix (额度显示 0% 根因).**
  - **What happened**: the UI showed 5h quota as 0% while `agy` reported 98% — the parsed quota data was CORRECT all along, but (a) any active local cooldown forced the 5h bar to render 0%, and (b) the loose rate-limit classifier kept creating ghost cooldowns: it scanned the ENTIRE stdout (model prose mentioning "rate limit"/"quota", hash fragments containing "429") and matched bare keywords, so an unrelated tool/permission error froze a healthy account out of rotation with a 15-minute+ cooldown (captured real reason: `rate limit reached: declaring permissions: cortex tool write_to_file … invalid tool call error`).
  - **Hard vs soft classification**: new `looksLikeHardRateLimit` (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED / code·status·HTTP 429 / too many requests / individual quota reached / quota exceeded·reached·exhausted / rate limit exceeded·reached·hit) is the ONLY pattern allowed to put an account into cooldown; soft signals (model overloaded / high traffic) still shape the error message but never cool accounts.
  - **Scan scope narrowed**: error classification reads stderr + the result envelope's error field only — stdout (event JSON + model prose) no longer participates.
  - **Honest quota bars**: a local cooldown no longer overwrites the server-reported fraction with 0%; it now appends a `· 本地冷却中` note next to the reset time instead.
  - Regression tests pin the exact incident text (cortex tool permission error) as a non-rate-limit fixture.

## 0.4.16 (2026-08-24)

- **External Re-Login Sync (换号自动/手动同步).**
  - **Root cause fixed**: after `agy logout` + re-login as a DIFFERENT account, the pool slot kept the old account's email, cooldowns, quotas and `auth_required` quarantine — and poll gating (0.4.15) then skipped the flagged slot forever, freezing the UI on the stale account.
  - **`resetAccountIdentity`**: detecting a changed email (from local CLI logs, zero network) now resets all identity-bound state (cooldowns / quotas / auth quarantine) while keeping slot config — the new account starts clean instead of inheriting the old one's restrictions.
  - **Zero-network reconciliation before poll gating**: the background poller pre-checks flagged slots via local log scan, so an external re-login self-heals within one poll cycle (≤15 min) without any extra request to Google. Manual click is instant.
  - **Auth self-heal on success**: a successful authenticated quota fetch clears a stale `auth_required` flag (the old token's invalid_grant no longer condemns the new login).
  - **Manual refresh upgrades**: the 刷新 button now also re-reads the model catalog (one `agy models` spawn per explicit click only — new subscription tier may expose different models), and every account card gains a 同步 button for single-account refresh.
  - **Primary slot always re-bootstrapped (real root cause of "UI stuck on old account")**: the primary slot was only created for an EMPTY pool, so once deleted it never came back while other accounts remained — the system-HOME login (e.g. after `agy logout` + re-login) had no slot to attach to and the UI kept showing an isolated account as 主账号. The slot is now recreated at the front on every load; deleting it no longer promotes an isolated account to primary. Disable the slot instead of deleting if unwanted.

## 0.4.15 (2026-08-24)

- **Quota Polling Risk-Exposure Minimization (root-cause follow-up).**
  - **Poll Interval 5min → 15min (configurable)**: New `quotaPollIntervalMs` config (env `DSH_AGY_QUOTA_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, clamped to >= 60s) cuts background `v1internal` polling volume by 3x — the poller was the last remaining high-frequency network surface after the CLI-level hardening.
  - **Restricted-Account Poll Gating**: Automatic polling now skips disabled, auth-quarantined (`invalid_grant`) and 429-cooldown accounts (`shouldPollAccount`), so the poller never keeps probing Google endpoints for accounts already known to be limited. Manual UI force-refresh still refreshes everything.
  - **Userinfo Endpoint Called Only When Email Unknown**: The primary account previously hit the OAuth userinfo endpoint on every poll cycle just to detect account switching; that detection now rides the local log scan (`detectEmailFromAgyLogs`, zero network), eliminating one network call per cycle.

## 0.4.14 (2026-08-24)

- **Hardened 429 Rate Limit Cooldown & Circuit Breaker (Anti-Risk Control).**
  - **Accurate Reset Duration Parsing**: Added `parseResetDurationMs` to accurately extract server reset countdowns from strings like `"Resets in 21m25s"`, `"Resets in 2h26m6s"`, `"Resets in 45s"`, or verbose duration phrases.
  - **Safety Cooldown Buffer**: Account failures on 429 now automatically apply the parsed reset duration + a 10s safety buffer (or a 15-minute minimum backoff), preventing accounts from re-triggering rate limiters at the exact millisecond of reset.
  - **Non-Retryable 429 Classification**: Identified 429 / quota exhaustion errors from stderr / stdout and classified them as non-retryable `Err.AGY_ERROR` instead of `Err.PROCESS_EXIT`, stopping DSH from executing automatic rapid retries on exhausted accounts.
- **Organic Spacing Jitter, In-Flight Debounce & Burst Protection.**
  - **Human-like Timing Jitter**: Added randomized timing jitter (`+100ms ~ 400ms`) on top of the 500ms single-account throttle to produce natural non-periodic traffic distributions that evade automated queue detection.
  - **In-Flight Session Debounce**: Rejects identical prompt submissions within a 3-second window while an existing request is active (`Err.BUSY`), preventing frontend repeat loops and double-clicks from hammering the backend.
  - **Sliding-Window Rate Limiter**: Added configurable `rateLimitPerMinute` protection across all sessions to prevent runaway `/goal` autonomous loops from draining daily quotas.
- **Account Health Quarantine & Self-Healing.**
  - **Invalid Grant Quarantine**: Automatically detects `invalid_grant` / revoked OAuth tokens during refresh and flags the account as `auth_required`, immediately taking it out of pool selection and alerting the user in UI.
  - **Visual Health Dashboard**: Added red alert badges (`需重新登录`) and health indicators on account cards.
  - **Automatic Fallback Model**: Supports `autoFallbackModel` to smoothly route requests to available lower-tier models when high-tier models are exhausted.
- **System Hygiene & Telemetry Minimization.**
  - **Telemetry Opt-out**: Injected telemetry suppression flags (`DO_NOT_TRACK`, `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`) into child process environments to reduce unnecessary background event tracking to Google `cclog`.
  - **Automated Old Log Purge**: Added `sweepOldLogs` on plugin boot to automatically sweep CLI log files older than 7 days across system and isolated account directories.

## 0.4.13 (2026-08-21)

- **Fixed Multimodal Image Attachment Staging & Direct Disk Fallback.**
  - **Dynamic Attachment Service Lookup**: Fixed Cordis proxy boundary issue where `(ctx as any).attachments` evaluated to `undefined` when not statically declared in `inject`; now resolves via `ctx.get('attachments')`.
  - **Local Storage Direct Disk Fallback**: Added direct fallback to read from DSH's local content-addressed storage (`~/.dsh/attachments/v1/objects/<prefix>/<id>`), guaranteeing 100% reliable image byte extraction even if service bindings are uninitialized.
  - **Explicit Vision Tool Directives**: Enhanced prompt staging lines to explicitly reference the `view_file` tool and absolute file path (`[image attached: "..." staged at ... Inspect it using the view_file tool with AbsolutePath: "..."]`), ensuring `agy` proactively inspects attached images even when the user sends an image without accompanying text.

## 0.4.12 (2026-08-21)

- **Adaptive Tool Dispatch for Both Standard / Native Mode and Code Mode.**
  - Dynamically inspects `options.tools` on each model stream call.
  - In **Code Mode** (`run_code` present in tools list): emits `run_code` program wrapping `tools['agy_tool'](...)` to conform to code-mode dispatch rules.
  - In **Standard / Native Mode** (`agy_tool` / normal tools present): emits `agy_tool` directly with structured cursor arguments, eliminating `unknown tool "run_code"` and `unknown tool "agy_tool"` errors across all preset modes.
- **Fixed Primary Account Stale Token & Quota Sync on macOS Keychain.**
  - `agy` 1.1.15+ on macOS persists active login credentials via `go-keyring` in the macOS Keychain (`service: "gemini"`, `account: "antigravity"`), leaving stale files in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` when users switch accounts outside DSH.
  - Added `readMacKeychainToken` to decode active `go-keyring-base64` credentials directly from macOS Keychain for the primary/system account.
  - Live quota & user profile (`fetchUserInfo`) now always read the active Keychain token, immediately detecting account switches and syncing the correct email and quotas.
- **Auto-Invalidate Conversation Binding on Model Switch.**
  - Switching models in the same DSH session now automatically drops the old agy `conversationId` binding, ensuring the prompt immediately executes with the new model without being locked to old agy conversation state.

## 0.4.11 (2026-08-21)

- **Fixed `Error: unknown tool "agy_tool": only run_code is callable directly` in DSH Code Mode.**
  - Restored the `run_code` wrapper dispatch (`WRAPPER_TOOL_NAME` + `buildMirrorRunCode`) for span cuts.
  - Under DSH's default Code Mode (`agent-presets: default: code`), model-direct tool calls are collapsed unless addressed to `run_code`. Wrapping the mirror invocation in `run_code` allows internal sub-dispatch to `agy_tool` to replay recorded events without being blocked by DSH's dispatch guard.

## 0.4.10 (2026-08-21)

- **Fixed `Error: unknown tool "run_code"` loop (Root Cause).**
  - Standard DSH agents and WebUI run direct tool dispatch without Code Mode runner (`run_code`). Emitting span cuts addressed to `run_code` triggered `ToolNotFoundError: unknown tool "run_code"` and trapped agy in an infinite error loop.
  - Span cuts now directly emit `agy_tool` tool-call blocks, which execute instantly and render native tool cards (Terminal, Diff, Read, Search).
- **Emphasized System Proxy & TUN Mode Requirements in README.**
  - Added prominent warnings and configuration instructions for system proxy, TUN mode, and environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`) required for Google connectivity in restricted regions.

## 0.4.9 (2026-08-20)

- **Theme-Adaptive System & High-Contrast Typography.**
  - Dynamic adaptation to DSH light and dark themes (`body[data-ds-dark-theme]` / `[data-theme="dark"]` / system preferences) across all UI elements (Settings section, header status badge `AGY (n)`, and modal console dialog).
  - High-contrast text & palette tuning: replaced hardcoded dark backgrounds and pale/white text with responsive semantic tokens, ensuring crystal clear legibility in light mode without washed-out or invisible text.
  - Redesigned quota bars, status pills, submodel breakdown rows, buttons, segment toggles, OAuth dialogs, and alert banners with theme-adaptive contrast.

## 0.4.8 (2026-08-20)

- **Pure SVG UI icon system (zero emojis).** Replaced tacky unicode emojis across the UI (trash can, star, plus, refresh, globe, mail, zap, alert, chevrons, close buttons) with clean, crisp, Lucide-style vector SVG icons for a professional developer experience.
- **Accurate quota window display & weekly lockout aggregation.**
  - Quota bars and breakdown rows now display clear window badges (`5h 滚动` / `周限额`) and time countdowns (`↻ 15:46 (4h36m)`).
  - Fixed family quota aggregation: bottleneck model selection now correctly binds the family `resetTime` to the bottleneck model with the lowest `remainingFraction` (and picks the furthest reset on tie), ensuring 7-day weekly rate limits are faithfully preserved and displayed.


- **Mid-turn steer preemption.** DSH claims a steered ("插话") message at the next step boundary and opens a NEW stream() call; the previous run's agy process used to stay alive and keep appending to the SAME conversation concurrently. The adapter now tracks the in-flight run per session and aborts it before starting the steered run (auxiliary calls neither preempt nor get tracked).
- **UI simplification.** Sidebar bottom-left shortcut removed (the console modal now lives on the header `AGY (n)` badge); quota rows are percent-first — brand logo + bar + `85%` + `↻ 14:44 · 3h12m` — with language-neutral `5h`/`7d` window badges and all Chinese status words (`充足/紧张/适中/未知`) dropped.

## 0.4.6 (2026-08-20)

- **Fixed premature context compaction (root cause).** agy's `result` envelope reports CONVERSATION-CUMULATIVE usage (input 3.8M / cacheRead 72M in the wild), while `step_update` usage is per-call (true current context). DSH's token meter treats the last sample as context occupancy, so forwarding the cumulative envelope exploded pressure past the 80%-of-1M threshold within a few turns and fired constant compactions. The mapper now reports the last per-call step sample (tracked on the shared run recording, span-safe); falls back to the envelope only when no step carried usage.
- **Quota windows + model logos in the UI.** Per-family bars now carry official Gemini / Claude / OpenAI brand SVG marks, a 5小时额度/周额度 window badge (inferred from reset distance), and a live reset countdown; per-model breakdown rows stay available on expand. Removed the verbose mechanism-explainer block.
- **Unified browser login everywhere.** `/agy auth` now runs the same PKCE + loopback-callback flow as the pool's add-account (new `PoolAuthFlow.beginPrimary()` writing agy-format tokens into the real HOME); the QR/code-paste-first copy is gone from README and command help. Primary flows never touch staging cleanup.
- **README refresh.** Install/login instructions match the browser flow; new References section (CLIProxyAPI, opencode-antigravity-auth, OmniRoute, pi-mono).

## 0.4.5 (2026-08-20)

- **Fixed Quota Display (Root Cause).**
  - agy ≥ 1.1.15 writes the token file in a NESTED shape (`{"token": {...}, "auth_method": "consumer"}` with ISO-8601 string expiry); the old flat parser read the nested `token` object as the access token string, producing `Authorization: Bearer [object Object]` → every quota fetch failed 401 → the UI permanently showed a fake `100% 充足`.
  - `normalizeStoredToken` now handles nested + flat shapes, ISO/epoch-second/epoch-ms expiries, and rejects non-string access tokens.
  - Token refresh now works out of the box via the public Antigravity client credentials (env-overridable with `AGY_CLIENT_ID`/`AGY_CLIENT_SECRET`), and quota fetch walks the verified 4-endpoint fallback order (daily → prod → daily-sandbox → autopush).
  - All Node-side Google calls now go through `src/host/net.ts` (undici's own fetch + EnvHttpProxyAgent): Node's built-in fetch ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY`, and mixing an external undici dispatcher into it throws `UND_ERR_INVALID_ARG` — both silently failed every call behind a proxy. Per-account `proxyUrl` wins over env.
  - The client renders an explicit grey `— 未知` state when no quota data exists instead of a fake 100%.
  - Background quota refresh every 5 minutes (token-file reads only — no agy spawns, no Keychain prompts).
- **Rebuilt Add-Account OAuth (Root Cause).**
  - The old flow scraped a login URL out of `agy -p ping` print mode; agy ≥ 1.1.15 never prints one when logged out, so the probe timed out after 20s and the route STILL returned `ok:true` — the UI claimed "浏览器已调起" while no browser ever opened, leaving a stuck `auth.phase='ok'` and orphaned `staging_*` dirs.
  - New self-owned flow (`src/host/oauth.ts` + `src/host/pool-auth.ts`): PKCE + public Antigravity client credentials + loopback callback listener on `http://localhost:51121/oauth-callback` (the redirect registered for the Antigravity client), browser opened server-side. The authorization code is captured automatically — no manual pasting; paste of a bare code or the full callback URL remains as fallback.
  - Tokens are written in agy's own on-disk format into the account's isolated HOME, so the official agy binary is immediately signed in for that account; email is resolved via userinfo and quota refreshed on commit.
  - Failures now return `ok:false` with the real reason; staging dirs are cleaned on failure/cancel, and stale `staging_*` dirs are swept at boot.
- **Fixed "cannot add a second account".** The server holds the `done` auth status for 30s so pollers can observe it; reopening the add-account panel inside that window replayed the previous success toast and closed the panel instantly. The client now only reacts to `done`/`failed` for a flow actually started from the current panel session.
- **Cross-Platform Hardening.**
  - Windows account isolation actually works now: `isolatedHomeEnv()` sets `USERPROFILE`/`HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH` alongside `HOME` — Node (libuv) and Go ignore `$HOME` on Windows, so secondary accounts previously shared the real user profile there. Applied to the adapter, the auth probe, and the terminal-login routes.
  - Windows browser open no longer breaks on the OAuth URL's `&` query separators (pre-quoted `cmd /d /s /c start "" "url"` with verbatim arguments).
  - Quota `User-Agent` now reflects the real platform/arch instead of a hardcoded `darwin/arm64` fingerprint.
  - Token file writes are mode-0600 on POSIX and safely skipped on Windows.
- **Fixed Settings Flicker (Residual).**
  - v0.4.3 removed the per-poll re-render; the remaining flash came from the settings modal unmounting the section on close — every reopen rendered a misleading amber "待认证" empty state until the first poll landed. A module-level status cache now seeds the first render instantly.
  - Removed the 2s pulse animation on status dots (static dots; color still conveys state) and added a fixed-height skeleton for the first-ever load.

## 0.4.3 (2026-08-20)

- **Eliminated macOS Keychain Prompts ("Antigravity Safe Storage").**
  - Removed periodic `agy models` process spawns from the high-frequency `/plugins/agy-link/status` endpoint.
  - The status endpoint now serves instantaneous cached state in 0ms, preventing macOS Gatekeeper / Security daemon from triggering keychain dialogs or access errors in background sessions.
- **Fixed UI Flickering & Re-render Thrashing.**
  - Implemented payload hash/equality checks before setting state in the React hook, completely eliminating re-render flashing during polling.
  - Cleaned up duplicated definitions in the client bundle.
- **Fixed Quota Percentage Display.**
  - Properly unified remaining quota percentage rendering for Gemini, Claude, and GPT-OSS families across all active and primary accounts (showing `100% 充足` / live percentages or cooldown time).

## 0.4.2 (2026-08-20)

- **Remaining Quota Quantitative Display & Clean Progress Meters.**
  - Every account card now displays explicit, quantitative remaining quota meters (percentages and progress bars) for all three model families: Gemini (`✨`), Claude (`🧠`), and GPT-OSS (`⚡`).
  - Active and healthy accounts display 100% capacity (or live fractional quota returned from Google CloudCode backend) with emerald green progress bars; accounts in cooldown display 0% with real-time countdown badges (`Xs 冷却`).
- **Eliminated False Premature Account Additions & Browser OAuth.**
  - Staging account slot isolation: new accounts are created in temporary staging directories and only committed to `pool.json` when authorization code verification actually succeeds (`code === 0`). Cancelling or failing auth cleans up staging files with zero ghost accounts left behind.
  - Automatic system browser launch (`open <url>` on macOS, `start` on Windows, `xdg-open` on Linux) when initiating account addition, plus a direct one-click fallback link in the UI.
- **Drastic WebUI Simplification & Modern Redesign.**
  - Clean, high-contrast, linear-style UI: removed all noisy explanatory paragraphs, repetitive buttons, and cluttered text disclaimers.
  - Compact account cards with essential actions (`设为主用`, `⚙️ 代理`, `🗑️ 移除`).
  - Sleek segmented pill controls for pool scheduling mode (`顺次耗尽` / `轮询均衡`), permission mode (`plan` / `accept-edits` / `skip`), and reasoning effort (`auto` / `low` / `medium` / `high`).

## 0.4.1 (2026-08-20)

- **Context Optimization & Compaction Lifecycle Sync (ADR-013).**
  - **Uniform 1M Context Window**: `resolveModel` uniformly advertises 1,048,576 (1M) context window across all Antigravity models (Gemini, Claude via Antigravity, GPT-OSS). Prevents DSH from prematurely firing context compaction requests due to agy's cumulative tool token reporting.
  - **Compaction-Aware Session Rebinding**: When DSH compacts history or clears session messages (detected by `messages.length < binding.lastMessageCount`), the adapter automatically releases the stale `conversationId` binding and seeds a fresh, clean agy session with the compacted summary digest, eliminating infinite compaction loops.
  - **Pure Transparent Message Pass-Through**: Multi-turn continuations in active bound sessions pass only the trailing user prompt + `--conversation <id>`, leaving conversation state management and tool chaning to Antigravity's native engine.
  - **Multimodal Support Fix**: Declared `inputModalities: ['text', 'image']` across all Antigravity models in `listModels` and `resolveModel`, enabling native drag-and-drop / paste image support in DSH.
  - **Unified One-Click macOS Terminal Login**: Streamlined account addition to native macOS Terminal auth with real Gmail extraction and visual health indicators.

## 0.4.0 (2026-08-20)

- **Multi-Account Pool & Process-Level Profile Isolation.**
  - Account pool management under `~/.dsh/agy-accounts/` with physical process-level environment isolation (`HOME=~/.dsh/agy-accounts/<id>/`).
  - Primary account rides system `HOME` to reuse Mac OS Keychain credentials without duplicate login.
  - Multi-profile Google OAuth flow: dynamic state machine per account, drop hardcoded OAuth credentials, secure in-memory and isolated disk storage.
  - Per-account proxy configuration (`ALL_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`) preventing IP correlation across accounts.
- **Sticky Sequential Drain (按模型家族顺次耗尽).**
  - Fine-grained rate limit tracking scoped to model family (`google`, `anthropic`, `openai`). Exhausting Claude quota will not penalize Gemini requests.
  - Transparent in-flight failover: upon encountering `429` / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, the active turn immediately and seamlessly switches to the next healthy account.
  - Automatic cooldown calculation with tiered backoff and reset time detection.
- **Real-Time Quota Progress Bars & Silent Degradation.**
  - Real-time token consumption and quota percentage tracking for all pooled accounts.
  - Quota statistics surface directly to DSH WebUI with visual progress bars and bottleneck indicators.
  - Graceful silent degradation: token polling failures fall back smoothly without interrupting ongoing runs.
- **DSH In-GUI Management & Slash Commands.**
  - New slash commands: `/agy pool`, `/agy add-account`, `/agy switch`, and `/agy quota`.
  - Rich WebUI status card with account list, quota meters, proxy badges, and fast switcher.

## 0.3.6 (2026-08-20)

- **Comprehensive Google OAuth login state machine & reliable QR rendering.**
  - Fixed broken QR image rendering by generating inline base64 data URLs directly in the `/status` payload (`auth.qrDataUrl`).
  - Added direct one-click authorization link (`👉 点击在浏览器中打开 Google 授权页面`) so users can open the consent URL in their browser tab with proxy support.
  - Implemented explicit state machine lifecycle: `signed-out` -> `pending` (URL & QR active) -> `submitting` (exchanging authorization code) -> `ok` (connected & refreshed) / `failed` (actionable error & restart).
  - Added `/plugins/agy-link/auth-cancel` endpoint and in-GUI Cancel / Restart buttons.
- **Fixed non-Gemini model execution (Claude Sonnet / Claude Opus / GPT-OSS).**
  - The agy CLI rejects the `--effort` flag for Claude and GPT-OSS models (`--effort is not supported for model ...`). The adapter now automatically strips `--effort` when calling non-Gemini models.
  - Added automatic model slug alias resolution: `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-opus` resolve to `claude-opus-4-6-thinking`; `gpt-oss-120b` resolves to `gpt-oss-120b-medium`.
  - Updated `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_MODELS` to match live agy 1.1.15 slugs.


- **Sliding activity watchdog for long-running tasks.** Replaced the static
  wall-clock timeout with an activity-based idle watchdog: the timer rearms
  on every chunk of stdout/stderr activity. Long-running tasks (e.g. multi-step
  refactors, extensive test suites, deep searches) can now run indefinitely as
  long as the process is actively working, while deadlocked/silent processes
  are still cleanly terminated after `timeoutMs` of complete inactivity.
  The agy CLI `--print-timeout` is given a generous ceiling (4h) to avoid
  premature termination of active print sessions.

## 0.3.4 (2026-08-19)

- **Tool activity moved out of the thinking panel into the reply body.**
  User feedback on 0.2.8: tool annotations hidden inside the DSH thinking
  fold were invisible and felt wrong. agy tools now render as visible
  `🔧 [agy tool: name] args -> output` lines in the message body (they
  cannot become native DSH tool cards: a finish:tool-calls would make the
  DSH agent try to execute tools it does not own — agy runs its own closed
  tool loop). The thinking panel keeps only what is genuinely thinking
  signal: `[agy thinking turn · N thinking tokens]` turn annotations
  (agy print mode never streams thinking text) and terminal error notes.

## 0.2.8 (2026-08-19)

- **Fix: real agy 1.1.15 stream-json parsing.** The parser only understood
  flat, hypothesized event shapes; the live CLI nests every step payload
  under a `step_update` envelope and uses a different vocabulary
  (`agent_response` + `text_delta` fragments, `tool` with `tool_name` /
  `tool_info` with `parameters` / `output` / `error`). As a result thinking
  and tool activity were silently dropped and only the final result text
  survived. Both shapes are now parsed (legacy aliases kept).
- **New: visible thinking turns + tool activity.** agy does not stream
  thinking text in print mode (only `thinking_tokens` usage), so each
  thinking-only `agent_response` turn surfaces as an annotated reasoning
  block (`[agy thinking turn · N thinking tokens]`), tool calls render as
  `[agy tool: name] args -> output` reasoning annotations, and failed tools
  render `[agy tool error: name] message`.
- **Fix: `result.status=ERROR` with a usable response** (e.g. a tool timed
  out mid-run) no longer discards the answer — the response streams, the
  error is annotated, the turn finishes normally. A bare envelope error
  now maps to a precise `AGY_ERROR` finish instead of INVALID_OUTPUT.
- **Fix: `agy models` deadlock — stdin pipe never closed.** agy reads stdin
  when it is a pipe and waits for EOF; every non-auth spawn kept the pipe
  open, so model discovery silently timed out and the catalog always fell
  back to the bundled list. Stdin now closes right after spawn (auth probes
  keep it open).
- **Fix: auth phase was always `idle`** until someone ran `/agy auth`, so
  the settings page claimed "needs Google login" for signed-in users.
  Status surfaces now lazily probe the real login state via `agy models`
  (60s cache) and report `ok` / `signed-out` truthfully.
- **Fix: `/plugins/agy-link/*` routes never registered on dsh web** (settings
  page stuck on `binary: not found / auth: unknown / models: 0`). Routes are
  now registered through a reactive `ctx.inject(['webServer'])` sub-fiber,
  so they attach whenever the service appears instead of racing it. The
  settings page also renders an honest "endpoint unreachable" state instead
  of misleading placeholders when the route is missing.
- **Removed: sidebar footer AGY button** (user request). Login (QR +
  authorization code) and mode/effort quick controls moved to Settings →
  Antigravity; the conversation header `AGY` pill stays.
- Tests: real-1.1.15 fixture modes (`real`, `real-error`, `real-fail`) and
  parser/mapper/adapter coverage for the nested format (73 tests).

## 0.2.7 (2026-08-19)

- Visible agy status in DSH: conversation header `AGY` pill, Settings → Antigravity status page, and sidebar footer label.
- Workspace auto-binding: agy now runs in the DSH session's `cwd` when `workspaceRoot` is not configured.
- New `/agy workspace [path]` command and `DSH_AGY_WORKSPACE_ROOT` env.
- README language switcher at the top (中文 / English).

## 0.2.2 (2026-08-19)

- README: dedicated Prerequisites section (DSH, Node >= 24, the agy CLI with Google's official install guide link, first-run login, subscription note), a "how it works" intro paragraph, and an honest "what it cannot do" list in both languages - onboarding now covers first-time users.
## 0.2.1 (2026-08-19)

- Cross-platform hardening (Linux / macOS / Windows):
  - binary discovery is platform-aware: agy / agy.exe / .cmd / .bat across
    PATH, ~/.local/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin,
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs, and the npm shim dir; a real executable is
    always preferred over a cmd shim
  - Windows .cmd/.bat shims spawn through cmd.exe with cross-spawn-style
    argument quoting (unit-tested)
  - tree-kill uses taskkill /T /F on Windows (Unix process groups do not
    exist there); detached sessions are POSIX-only so no console window
    flashes on Windows
  - CRLF stdout is normalized (trailing \r stripped per line)
  - the MCP bridge script path resolves via fileURLToPath (URL.pathname
    would yield /C:/... on Windows and break the spawn)
- 5 new cross-platform tests (56 total).

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-19)

- Multimodal (path-based): DSH image attachments are staged to a local media
  directory (config `mediaDir`, TTL sweep `mediaTtlMs`, caps `mediaMaxBytes` /
  `mediaMaxImages`) and referenced by absolute path in the agy prompt with
  `--add-dir` - agy views them with its own tools. Env: `DSH_AGY_MEDIA_DIR`,
  `DSH_AGY_MEDIA_TTL_MS`.
- `agy_ask` gains `readPaths` (inline text files into the one-shot prompt;
  binaries skipped with a note) and `schema` (JSON Schema enforced via
  `--json-schema`).
- MCP reverse bridge (experimental, `mcpBridge: true` / `DSH_AGY_MCP_BRIDGE=1`):
  agy can call DSH-side tools through a loopback, token-guarded endpoint plus a
  zero-dep stdio MCP server merged into the workspace `.mcp.json`.
  `mcpToolAllowlist` restricts the exposed set; `run_code` / `agy_ask` are
  never bridged.
- Abort semantics locked by a regression test: everything the model produced
  before the caller hits stop is preserved (open block closed, then failure
  finish).
- 12 new tests (51 total).

## 0.1.5 (2026-08-19)

- README restructured into a single bilingual page: Chinese first, then
  English (README.zh.md removed; package files list updated).
- Releases now publish to npm automatically (NPM_TOKEN secret configured).
